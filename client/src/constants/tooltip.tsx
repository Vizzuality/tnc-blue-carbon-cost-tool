        allows for the entry of project-specific emission factors for both
        Aboveground Biomass (AGB) and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), each expressed
        in tCO2e per hectare per year. By separating AGB and SOC, this approach
        enables a more detailed and tailored estimate of carbon sequestration
        and emissions specific to the project site. The AGB value represents the
        committed emissions from aboveground vegetation, such as trees, shrubs,
        and other plant matter, while the SOC value accounts for the carbon
        stored in the soil. Both of these emission factors are influenced by

        Carbon Revenues to Cover provides the flexibility to determine whether
        carbon revenues should be used to cover only OPEX (Operational
        Expenditures) or both CAPEX (Capital Expenditures) and OPEX. This option
        allows developers to account for external funding sources such as grants
        or philanthropic contributions that may be used to cover a portion of
        the costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given that CAPEX, which includes start-up and implementation costs, is
        typically higher in blue carbon projects, it is generally recommended
        that these costs be covered by other funding sources. In contrast, OPEX,
        which includes ongoing operational and maintenance costs, could be
        sustainably supported by the revenue generated from carbon credits. This
        feature provides flexibility based on the funding strategy and the

  BUFFER: (
    <>
      <p>
        When considering carbon credits, it is crucial to account for
        non-permanence, leakage, and uncertainty, which are significant factors.
        These factors are encompassed within the &apos;buffer&apos; assumption
        in the Blue Carbon Cost Tool, where the default value is set at 20%.
      </p>
      <p>
        While modeling specific scenarios, it is valuable to undertake the
        exercise of calculating non-permanence, leakage, and uncertainty.
      </p>
      <List>
        <li>
          Non-permanence: Verra offers the VCS Non-permanence risk tool, which
          can be employed to estimate non-permanence. This tool considers
          various risks, including internal factors (e.g., project management,
          project longevity), natural elements (e.g., extreme weather events),
          and external influences (e.g., land tenure, political aspects).
        </li>
        <li>
          Leakage: Estimating leakage can be challenging. However, it may be
          minimal if the project satisfies specific conditions, for example the
          project area having been abandoned or previous commercial activities
          having been unprofitable. Additionally, inclusion of leakage
          mitigation activities (e.g., ecosystem services payments) within the
          project can further reduce leakage potential.
        </li>
        <li>
          Uncertainty: The allowable uncertainty is 20% at 90% confidence level
          (or 30% of Net Emissions Reductions at 95% confidence level). In cases
          where the uncertainty falls below these thresholds, no deduction for
          uncertainty would be applicable. More guidance can be found in
          Verra&apos;s Tidal wetlands and seagrass restoration methodology. In
          cases where uncertainty falls above this threshold, you must deduct an
          amount equal to the amount that exceeds uncertainty. For example, if
          uncertainty is 28% at a 90% confidence level, you must deduct an
          additional 8% from your emissions reductions. When using the tool,
          this amount should be added to the buffer (in addition to
          non-permanence and leakage amounts).
        </li>
      </List>
    </>
  ),

  BASELINE_REASSESSMENT_FREQUENCY: (
    <p>
      Baseline Reassessment Frequency refers to how often the baseline emissions
      or sequestration values are reassessed to ensure the project&apos;s
      ongoing accuracy in estimating carbon impacts. This is typically done at
      regular intervals to account for changes in project conditions or new
      data, ensuring that the original assumptions remain valid throughout the
      project&apos;s lifespan. Each baseline reassessment will incur additional
      cost, which the tool accounts for according to the frequency set. The

      Conservation Project Length refers to the duration over which conservation

      preserving and protecting existing ecosystems to prevent further
      degradation and enhance carbon sequestration over time. The length of a
      conservation project is typically long-term, as it involves ongoing
      monitoring and management to ensure ecosystem stability and carbon storage
      potential. The tool default project length is 20 years but may be adjusted
      to up to 30 years.

        Users have the option to adapt the restoration rate depending on what is
        feasibly restorable per year. Make sure the project size is adapted
        according to this rate and the duration of the restoration activity. For
        example, if the reasonable restoration rate is 50 ha / year and you will
        restore for five years, your project size will be 250 ha total.
