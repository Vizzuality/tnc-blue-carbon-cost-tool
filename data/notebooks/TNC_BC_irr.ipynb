    "# Introduction: Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Solution Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** is a fundamental financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of investments or projects. IRR is defined as the discount rate that makes the Net Present Value (NPV) of a series of cash flows equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "NPV = \\sum_{t=0}^{N} \\frac{C_t}{(1 + IRR)^t} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( C_t \\) is the cash flow at time \\( t \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods for Solving IRR\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no general analytical solution for IRR with arbitrary cash flows, so it must be found using numerical methods. The most common approaches include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Newton-Raphson Method:** An iterative root-finding algorithm that converges quickly if the initial guess is close to the true IRR. Used by libraries such as [numpy-financial's irr](https://numpy.org/numpy-financial/latest/irr.html) and many financial calculators.\n",
    "- **Bisection Method:** A slower but more robust iterative method that always converges if the function changes sign over the interval.\n",
    "- **Centroid-based Newton-Raphson:** An improved variant of Newton-Raphson that uses the centroid (average) of the current and next guesses to potentially reduce the number of iterations required for convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different software tools may use different algorithms and stopping criteria. For example, Microsoft Excel’s IRR function uses an iterative approach and **has important limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration Cap:** Excel’s IRR algorithm stops after 20 iterations if it does not converge, returning a `#NUM!` error (effectively a NaN).\n",
    "- **Sensitivity to Initial Guess:** If the initial guess is not close to the actual IRR, Excel may fail to find a solution within the iteration limit.\n",
    "- **Multiple Roots:** If there are multiple IRRs (possible with non-standard cash flows), Excel may return only one or fail to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, some libraries (such as [node-irr](https://github.com/eric-malachias/irr)) use Newton-Raphson with a fallback to bisection and do not cap the number of iterations as strictly, making them more robust for complex cash flow scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates IRR calculation and compares these numerical methods, highlighting the differences and limitations of each approach."
